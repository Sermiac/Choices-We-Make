Follow this instructions if you are editing the story:

### = ignores the lines and is not processed as a story line

### optionalText = the following lines will be used as not story mode lines (used usually as extra help for the player)
(maximum 2 lines for now)

blank spaces = these are not taken as story lines


If you are going to add more scenes, you need to add the number of scenes that you will be using:
Bathroom_1
House_1
House_2
House_n...


Also, first line will be used when you get into the scene. After that, it will be processed in order by each interactable:
(I am planning to change this to be more dynamic)
House : Cellphone, Bed
Bathroom : Hole
